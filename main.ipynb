    "Write a main.ipynb notebook that summarizes and discusses your results. It can contain figures referenced from disk or simple summary information (for example if you want to display part of a dataframe) from variables read from disk, but no significant computations at all. Think of this as your “paper”.\n",

You have no control over the original data acquisition and measurement, and for many of you this project will likely fall under the broad purview of Exploratory Data Analysis. If you propose any statistical hypothesis/model in your analysis, discuss your justifications, considering how the data was acquired. We are not expecting you to spend a lot of time dealing with how to best model or describe the data. Try to identify a few scientifically interesting but simple questions you can address and then focus on writing the code for such an analysis.\n",

This section should indicate, for each team member, what they did in the project. It doesn’t have to be a long, detailed story, a few sentences per person should suffice. All team members must agree to the language in this section. (By the way, this is standard practice in many scientific journals). While in principle the project grade is the same for all team members, we reserve the right to lower the grade of anyone who doesn’t contribute to the team effort."
