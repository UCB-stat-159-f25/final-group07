# Data Access and Restrictions

This project uses traffic crash data obtained from the California
Transportation Injury Mapping System (TIMS), maintained by the
University of California and Caltrans.

The TIMS data is subject to federal and state legal restrictions,
including but not limited to 23 U.S.C. § 409 and California Vehicle
Code § 20014. As a result, the raw data is distributed inside this repository.
All users using this data are automatically subject to the "Terms of Use" agreement
that comes with downloading this data from the TIMS website.

Users wishing to reproduce this analysis may obtain TIMS data
