University of California and Caltrans.

The TIMS data is subject to federal and state legal restrictions,
including but not limited to 23 U.S.C. § 409 and California Vehicle
Code § 20014. As a result, the raw data **cannot be redistributed**
and is **not included in this repository**.

Access to TIMS data requires user agreement with the terms provided
